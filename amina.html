    <h1> I love going to museums and walking through gardens. My favorite color is purple and my favorite class is Art. I see myself as a very quiet person, though I can be very loud when I want to be. I'm very straightforward with things, I don't like beating around the bush. I honestly will miss this class as I like working on projects like this. I will be leaving the high school campus this year and entering a college campus and I am still 16 years old.</h1>
